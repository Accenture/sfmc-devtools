Accenture Salesforce Marketing Cloud DevTools (mcdev) is a rapid deployment/rollout, backup and development tool for Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It allows you to retrieve and deploy configuration and code across Business Units and instances.

## Quick start

### Install

Run the following to install Accenture SFMC DevTools on your computer:

```bash
npm install -g mcdev
```

### VSCode Extension

We also provide a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Accenture-oss.sfmc-devtools-vscode) that integrates SFMC DevTools into your IDE. You can install it from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Accenture-oss.sfmc-devtools-vscode).

### Include in your package

First, install it as dependency:

```bash
npm install mcdev --save
```

You can then include it in your code with JavaScript/ES module imports:

```javascript
import mcdev from 'mcdev';
```

That will load `node_packages/mcdev/lib/index.js`. It can make sense to directly include other files if you have a special scenario. We've done that in our example for [retrieveChangelog.js](https://github.com/Accenture/sfmc-devtools/blob/main/lib/retrieveChangelog.js) or in more detail, in our child-project [sfmc-devtools-copado](https://github.com/Accenture/sfmc-devtools-copado) to get full control over certain aspects.
